# misC
Some C shenanigans. Mainly macro related stuff. 

## Build
Run in [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Windows (with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) installed). Should go well... probably.

Not tested in Linux nor Mac OS X.

If you try compiling it in any other way, don't try to `make all`, just stick with `make applic`. No ideia why I left the library generation.
